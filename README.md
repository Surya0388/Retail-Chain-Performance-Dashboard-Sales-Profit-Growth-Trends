Key Learnings
how reatil sales data can massively affect decision making capability for the reatil chain company and can benefit in implementation of new decisions
theough this data we can figure out which market region in the state is performing the best and the underperforming for the underperforming region we can deep dive into the loss making factors or things that dont contribute much to the revenue example a particualr product category that doesnt contribute to the revenue 
oil and masala account for sales in the north region and the Snacks category accounts for very less sales 
the snacks and Meat account for high sales in all region except north there fore if any snacks brand want to launch its new product it can start through the west region as that is where the sales are high
and certain measures can be taken in bosoting the revenue in the north region or resource allocation can be planned out so that the region does not burn a hole in the revenue reserves of the company
and discounts category wise can be monitored and this can impact the procurement (Example the procurement costs should be reduced in order for the company to increase their discount margin)
the branches statewide that do not contribute to the revnue and attract more cost should be shut down or as per the data there are 24 branches that are present in the state which are functioning currently so in the northern region which is underperforming compared to other region , the branches in the this region can be reduced in a tactical way example the locations which have 2 branches in diffrent locations they can be replaced with 1 branch which is nearby both the locations or remove the branches completely
